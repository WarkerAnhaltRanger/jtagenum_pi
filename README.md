# jtagenum_pi
This is a python port of the great jtagenum (https://github.com/cyphunk/JTAGenum) tool from cyphunk.
It should be used to detect JTAG-Pins from a number of candidate Pins.

WARNING

Check your Voltages! Raspi is 3.3V
Use resistors to protect your driver pins. (I'm using 470ohm resistors)
